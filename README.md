# RANK-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the rank of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## ALGORITHM
## Step 1:
we have to intialise program using import numpy to perform mathematical calculation
## Step 2:
The input from the user is stored in the variable a
## Step 3:
Using the np.linalg.matrix_rank(), we can find the rank of the given matrix.
## Step 4: 
end of the program.

## Program:
```
#Program to find the rank of a matrix.
#Developed by: VEDHANTH H
#RegisterNumber:24003775
import numpy as np
A = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
              [3, 6, 9]])
rank = np.linalg.matrix_rank(A)
print(rank)
```
## Output:

## Result:
Thus the rank for the given matrix is successfully solved by  using a python program.
